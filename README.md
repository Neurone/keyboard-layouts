##List of layouts

###Italian Keyboard Layout for Developers

The following combinations added:

* AltGr + ì = ~
* AltGr + ' = `
* AltGr + d = ð
* AltGr + Shift + d = Ð
* AltGr + Shift + e = Ξ [only for UTF-8 capable applications, otherwise ? will be printed]

## Editors

To edit **klc** files you can use the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665.aspx). MKLC can also create installer files from klc files, so you can distribute your own keyboard layout to other users.

## Precompiled installers

* [italian-keyboard-for-developers-1.0.zip](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=E0EDEC79268FC32E!1086&authkey=!AL7F1NfjF-ExApk&ithint=file%2czip)

After the installation you often need restart Windows in order to enable all keyboard changes.
