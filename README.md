# Keyboard layouts
Repository containing various keyboard layouts, even that at the moment you can actually find only one :)

## List of layouts

### Italian Keyboard Layout for Developers

The following combinations added:

* AltGr + ì = ~
* AltGr + ' = `
* AltGr + d = ð
* AltGr + Shift + d = Ð
* AltGr + Shift + e = Ξ   *(only for UTF-8 capable applications, otherwise character '?' will be printed)*

## Editors

To edit **klc** files you can use the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665.aspx). MSKLC can also create installer files from klc files, so you can distribute your own keyboard layout to other users.

## Precompiled installers

Visit the [releases](https://github.com/Neurone/keyboard-layouts/releases) page to download precomplied layouts. After the installation you often need to restart Windows in order to enable all keyboard changes.
